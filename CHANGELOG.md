# v0.1.1
## 09/12/2026

1. [](#new)
   * Reworked the layout shell - `base.html.twig`, the nav macro, footer, logo,
     theme toggle - with Tailwind utility classes, replacing Quark 2's Blades-CSS
     classless markup. JS-driven state hooks (`.dropmenu`, `.has-children`, `.open`,
     `.flip-x`, `#toggle.active`, `.scrolled`, `.overlay`) kept as-is so
     `site.js`/`theme-toggle.js` needed no changes.

2. [](#bugfix)
   * `theme-toggle.js` still stored the appearance preference under the old
     `quark2-theme` localStorage key, which didn't match `base.html.twig`'s
     `bastion-theme` pre-paint bootstrap - the stored preference was silently
     ignored on every reload. Renamed to match.

# v0.1.0
## 09/12/2026

1. [](#new)
   * Initial scaffold: copied from Grav's Quark 2 skeleton (MIT), renamed to Bastion,
     wired up the `tailwind4` plugin (PHP-compiled Tailwind CSS 4, no npm) in place of
     Quark 2's Blades CSS build. Templates still carry Quark 2's original markup and
     have not yet been reworked with Tailwind utility classes.
